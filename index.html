    <h2>web</h2>
    <p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL), enabling browsers to retrieve these resources from a web server and display them on the user's device.

    A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[1][2] For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as google.com, that stores searchable data about other websites. But to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user needs to have a web browser installed on their device.[3]

    As of March 2019, more than 4.3 billion people are web browser users, around 55% of the worldâ€™s population.  Their success is in part caused by their flexibility, due to their Turing-complete execution and powerful graphic capabilities.[4]

    The most popular browsers are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge.</p>
